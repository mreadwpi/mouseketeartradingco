                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Founded by 2 sisters who love Disney and making Magic for others.
                We started Mousketear Trading Co. In March of 2020 after both losing our jobs due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. Our family has always had a love for all things Disney. All of the movies and shows Disney has created over the years were a large part of our formative years, and the magic that we experience as a family with each visit makes Disney a second home to us. We have both always had a passion for creativity and DIY Projects. Because of this, we decided to combine our passion for Disney and our creativity to develop products that would bring some of Disney's magic to fellow Disney lovers everywhere. Now, we run this shop together as a power sister duo while Liz completes her Mechanical Engineering Degree and Emily completes her Prosthetic and Orthotic Residency. Though we may be apart, we still work together to create magic for you all!</p>
